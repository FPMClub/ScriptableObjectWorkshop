# ScriptableObjectWorkshop

Building modular and flexible systems is a core component of game development. With Unityâ€™s Scriptable Object class, you can store shared data independent from scripts, opening a number of unique design possibilities. Learn the ins and outs of Scriptable Objects, and how to use them for an inventory backend, asset-based variables, and a game event system in this intermediate-level workshop.

Download the "Empty" Unity package and import it into Unity to get started.  Presentation files, notes, and a finished demonstration package will be added or linked below after the workshop.
