# ScriptableObjectWorkshop

Building modular and flexible systems is a core component of game development. With Unityâ€™s Scriptable Object class, you can store shared data independent from scripts, opening a number of unique design possibilities. Learn the ins and outs of Scriptable Objects, and how to use them for an inventory backend, asset-based variables, and a game event system in this intermediate-level workshop.

Download the "Empty" Unity project and import it into Unity to get started.
